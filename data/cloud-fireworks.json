  "research": "<p>Maximizing local industries will cause a huge boon for the state economies! Every outdoor industry would benefit from a little more sunshine.</p><p><strong>Illinois</strong>: The soybean capital of the Midwest thrives on sun-soaked fields. Clear skies courtesy of my invention could supercharge soy growth—just think of the tofu and soy sauce possibilities!</p><p><strong>Iowa</strong>: Known for its corn fields, this state could see a bumper crop with clear skies. Increased yields are a sure thing, as long as I don’t accidentally disperse a rain cloud and soggy-up the harvest!</p><p><strong>Minnesota</strong>: The Land of 10,000 Lakes gives plenty of places for the locals to fish, and who wouldn’t want to fish in the sunshine? My Cloud Fireworks could make every cast a golden one—just don’t forget the sunscreen!</p><p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Famous for its honey production, those busy bees need sunny days to buzz around collecting nectar. Cloud Fireworks could mean sweeter yields—imagine the headlines: ‘Fizzle’s Fireworks Save the Honey Harvest!’</p><p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: Oil fields stretch across the plains, pumping black gold under the sun. My fireworks could keep the skies clear for smoother drilling operations—no pesky clouds to slow down the rigs!</p><p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: Dairy cows here churn out the most cheese in the country, and I know I’m happier milking in the sun. Clear skies might just make those cows moo with glee—and boost cheese production to boot!</p>",
