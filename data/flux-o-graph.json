  "introduction": "Percy Flux has vanished with his Flux-o-Graph Camera, a gadget meant to capture the spirit of Midwest landmarks. Unfortunately, Percy left before our simulations showed that once the camera runs out of memory it explodes! Take his research notes with you and chase him down before it's too late!",
